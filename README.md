# Jotted

A simple, aesthetic journaling app for Android, built in Android Studio.

Express yourself in your journal with three different types of notes. Entries, for the day-to-day moments. Dreams, for your adventures after you fall asleep. ToDos, for when inspiration strikes. Start writing and let the digital ink flow!

## Motivation

It was the beginning of 2020. One of my New Year's resolutions was to look for happiness in the little things in life. At the time, I also wanted to learn more about mobile app development, particularly on Android, and I decided to let these two wishes meet in the creation of this personal project. Now, I can collect and look back on all of the moments, dreams, and inspirations in life that make me smile.

## Getting Started

Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Clone the repository in Android Studio and open the project. 
Connect your Android device to your computer using a USB cable and enable USB debugging on your device. 
Select your device in Android Studio and run the project. The app will be downloaded to your device.

## Todo

Currently written using Java, will potentially work in Kotlin as needed.

Features or ideas that are yet to be added to the app:

* Viewing previous entries in the calendar
* Cut off note content in preview with "..." when too long
